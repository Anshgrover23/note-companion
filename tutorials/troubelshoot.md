## I'm getting an error on the organizer

Most likely issue: you have too many folders. Check this screen in settings (Vault Access)

Try to ignore some folders and try again. If it works it means we can't proccess all your folder.

If you're importing files from another system. Try to put them all in a seperate folder, mark it as ignore and try to do it step by step.


## I'm getting "Too many requests"

Try to organize less files at once. We usually recommend max 100 files.
