# File Organizer 101 - How it works

1. Select any of your files or folders within your vault

2. Move your item(s) into the dedicated `FileOrganizer2000/Inbox` as seen in the screenshot below.

3. Give it some time to process. Usually less than a second for a text file. Audio or Image files may take longer.

4. Fo2k will then perform three key actions with the help of AI:

   I.  Rename the document title ยบ
   II.  Add tags if there are any connections with your other tagged  files ยบ
   III.  Move your file to the most appropriate folder. If no appropriate folder has been identified, the file move to the `FileOrganizer2000/Processed` 

   ยบ if enabled in plugins options

   Good to know:

- For audio files: a text transcription will be added to the processed document.
- For image files: annotations will be added to the processed document
- More actions not covered in this doc are also configurable within the plugin options. We ship very regularly!
- Any file processed by fo2k will be tagged with #fo2k-processed
