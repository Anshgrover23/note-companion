## How to use

### A. AI Assistant View

### B. AI Inbox

Auto-organize with the AI Inbox.

We recommend the AI Assistant view for more control. But the AI Inbox can be handy as well. Simply move any of your files to the "Inbox" folder and the plugin will automatically move it to the folder it belongs. Additional configuration can also be specified within the plugin settings (e.g. auto-tagging, auto-formatting).

Move your unorganized files into `_FileOrganizer2000/Inbox`

It takes a sec, and then renames, and organizes your file.

how to set it up: https://youtu.be/zWJgIRlDWkk?si=HSeOUKaMfJvaLtKI

Notes:
- It works when your vault is on a cloud drive. I use it with iCloud and works great. Doesn't work with OneDrive last time I tested.
- Currently only works if your iOS is in English. But if you reach out on discord I can help you set it up in your language.

## To Do

- [ ] Release a local LLM-only version.
- [ ] Implement browser access into AI chat.

### Notes

This plugin interacts with your filesystem.
