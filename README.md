# AI File Organizer 2000

  
ThisÂ is an Obsidian PluginÂ that uses AI to keep your files organized. It transcribes audio, uses AI to annotate images, and automatically renames and moves new files to the most likely folders.



### Features

  
- AutomaticallyÂ move files to correct folder
- Supports text, audio, and images
- Local-first LLM support (coming soon, like very soon there's already a branch)


### Self-hosting

Atm a bit complicated but we'll strive to make it simpler very soon. Great first issue if you want to get your hands dirty ðŸ˜€.

1. Run the next js repo inside of `./app` (`npm i && OPENAI_API_KEY=[your open ai api key] )
2. You need to subsite the hardcoded url inside of all the `./modules` files and replace it with your localhost version.


I know, I know this seems complicated and undcalled for. But we're taking this to the next step and that's the route that will lead us to move as fast possible.



### Quickstart
In the plugin settings, provide your OpenAI API Key. That's it :)

## How to use

Simply move any of your files to the "Inbox" folder and the plugin will automatically move it to the most likely folder.
