## üöÄ Getting Started

Choose your preferred setup:

### A. Cloud Subscription

2. No setup required - just activate your license key
3. Regular updates and new features

### B. Self-Hosted Solution

1. Run the server
   For Linux/macOS:

   ```
   And make sure you have your `OPENAI_API_KEY` variable set up in your `.env.local` file inside the `packages/web` directory. If you want to use Amazon Bedrock models, you'll also need to configure AWS credentials (`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_REGION`).
   For Windows (PowerShell):
   ```sh
   cd packages/web; pnpm build:self-host; pnpm start
   ```
   And make sure you have your `OPENAI_API_KEY` variable set up in your `.env.local` file inside the `packages/web` directory.

Notes:
- It works when your vault is on a cloud drive. I use it with iCloud and works great. Doesn't work with OneDrive last time I tested.
